            <p>
                Born in December of 1947, Jeff Lynne is the founder and lead singer of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). 
                He started the band in 1970 and produced 15 studio albums with the band, plus 2 solo albums in 1990 and 2012.

        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ELO is my favorite band of all time. Their music always puts me in a good mood whenever I listen to them. 
        The band also reminds me a lot of my dad. Their album "Out of the Blue" was my dad's first album that he ever owned.
         I've recently started collecting vinyl records and hope to own all of my favorite albums of thier's one day!</p>
