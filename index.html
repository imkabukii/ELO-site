    <h1>Who is Jeff Lynne</h1>
    <p>Born in December of 1947, Jeff Lynne is the founder and lead singer of Electric Light Orchestra(ELO). 
        He started the band in 1970 and produced 15 studio albums with the band, plus 2 solo albums in 1990 and 2012.
        Lynne was heavily inspired by The Beatles, which is reflected in his distinct musical style</p>
    <h1>What ELO means to me</h1>
    <p>ELO is my favorite band of all time. Their music has helped me through some very hard times in recent years. 
        The band also reminds me a lot of my dad. Their album "Out of the Blue", was my dad's first album that he ever owned.
         I've recently started collecting vinyl records and hope to own all of my favorite albums of thier's one day!</p>
